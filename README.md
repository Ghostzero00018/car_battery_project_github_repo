# Car Battery Project — Thermal Control & Forced Convection

Thermal control testbed for a compact battery enclosure. This repo gathers models, experiments, and reference docs for **forced convection**, **oven tests**, and **fan sizing/control** (Sunon DC brushless).

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Size airflow & heating power to reach/hold target temperatures with <1% overshoot.
- Study the effect of **single intake + leak** vs **side vents** on temperature and pressure.
- Select and control a **12 V Sunon axial fan** (PWM/voltage), and log **pressure/temperature**.
- Build a simple controller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) to stabilize internal air temperature.
